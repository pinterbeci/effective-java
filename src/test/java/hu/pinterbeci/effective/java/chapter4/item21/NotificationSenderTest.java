                  Prior to Java 8, it was impossible to add methods to interfaces without breaking
                  existing implementations. If you added a new method to an interface, existing
                  implementations would, in general, lack the method, resulting in a compile-time
                  error. In Java 8, the default method construct was added [JLS 9.4], with the
                  intent of allowing the addition of methods to existing interfaces. But adding new
                  methods to existing interfaces is fraught with risk.
                  The declaration for a default method includes a default implementation that is
                  used by all classes that implement the interface but do not implement the default
                  method. While the addition of default methods to Java makes it possible to add
                  methods to an existing interface, there is no guarantee that these methods will
                  work in all preexisting implementations. Default methods are “injected” into
                  existing implementations without the knowledge or consent of their
                  implementors. Before Java 8, these implementations were written with the tacit
                  understanding that their interfaces would never acquire any new methods.
                  Many new default methods were added to the core collection interfaces in
                  Java 8, primarily to facilitate the use of lambdas (Chapter 6). The Java libraries’
                  default methods are high-quality general-purpose implementations, and in most
                  cases, they work fine. But it is not always possible to write a default method
                  that maintains all invariants of every conceivable implementation.
                  For example, consider the removeIf method, which was added to the
                  Collection interface in Java 8. This method removes all elements for which
                  a given boolean function (or predicate) returns true. The default
                  implementation is specified to traverse the collection using its iterator, invoking
                  the predicate on each element, and using the iterator’s remove method to
                  remove the elements for which the predicate returns true. Presumably the
                  declaration looks something like this. --> to be continue;
